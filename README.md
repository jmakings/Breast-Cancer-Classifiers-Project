# Breast-Cancer-Classifiers-Project

## This project involved two distinct classification tasks: 
### 1. Development and evaluation of breast cancer vs "healthy" patient classifier
### 2. Development and evaluation of recurrent vs non-recurrent breast cancer classifier

The second task has not been reached in the field at time of writing (June 2022). 

The transcript data used to create these classifiers comes from SILVER-Seq (Small Input Liquid Volume ExRNA-Sequencing), where just 5 Âµl of human serum is sequenced. 

Our methods and results for implementing these classifiers is described in the report and powerpoint presentation. A Jupyter Notebook of my source code is also provided. 

For more information about SILVER-Seq and the paper from Dr. Sheng Zhong's lab that enspired this project, the paper [Zhou et al., Extracellular RNA in a single droplet of human serum reflects physiologic and disease states](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1908252116) goes into greater detail on this technology. 

The data used is courtesy of Dr. Sheng Zhong, which can be found on his lab [github.](https://github.com/Zhong-Lab-UCSD/breast_cancer_recurrence_classifier)

This was the final project for CSE 283: Data Wrangling in Bioinformatics, Spring 2022.
